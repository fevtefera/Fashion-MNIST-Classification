## üßæ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Build a CNN to classify clothing items into categories such as T-shirt, Dress, Sneakers, etc.
- **Dataset**: [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images).
- **Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, PySpark, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

### Real-World Applications
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Automating product classification for online stores like Amazon, Zara, etc.
- **Visual Search**: Enable search for similar products by image.
- **Caption Automation**: Generate automated product descriptions based on image classification.
